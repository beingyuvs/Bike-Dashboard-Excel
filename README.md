# 🚴‍♂️ Bike Sales Dashboard – From Data to Insights! 📊

Excited to share my project, built from scratch in Excel, after completing the **"Data for Business Analysts Using Microsoft Excel"** course on Coursera!

This interactive dashboard provides key insights into bike purchase trends based on factors like income, age, commute distance, marital status, education, and region. It was a great hands-on experience in data visualization, pivot tables, and decision analysis.
